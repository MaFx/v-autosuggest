# Contributing to V-autosuggest
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Really means a lot to me since this is my first ever open source project! 🎉👍

There are a few things that is needed
- Demo component in github pages
- Unit testing
- code improvement ( god knows this isn't the best out there)


And I'd like to say thank you for giving your time to contributing to this project.
